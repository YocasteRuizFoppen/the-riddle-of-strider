    <h1>"The Riddle of Strider"</h1>
    <p>
      All that is gold does not glitter,
      <strong>Not all those who wander are lost;</strong>
      The old that is strong does not wither,
      Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
  
      From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
      A light from the shadows shall spring;
      Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
      The crownless again shall be king.
      — J.R.R. Tolkien, The Riddle of Strider, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</p>
